# State Machine

## Deprecated info
This was a school assignment where we were given a basic state machine that used inheritence and had to extend it. I chose to extend it by making it a hierarchical state machine. 

Whilst I was working with this code I realized it was really annoying and a lot of work to create new states. This is why I deprecated it and started working on a simple to use state machine.

## Project
This is a header-only state machine written in C++, focusing on simplicity and usability. Currently the state machine header file depends on the stl library. I chose to avoid inheritence with this small project as a challange and also to avoid any vtables. 



## To-Do
- ~~make headeronly~~
- add proper example(s)
- ~~adjust cmakelist for including in other projects~~
