# State Machine
## Project

This is a header-only state machine written in C++, focusing on simplicity and usability. I chose to avoid inheritence with this small project as a challange and also to avoid any vtables. 


## To-Do
- make headeronly
- add proper example(s)
- adjust cmakelist for including in other projects
