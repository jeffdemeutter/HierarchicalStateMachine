# State Machine

## Project
This is a header-only state machine written in C++, focusing on simplicity and usability. Currently the state machine header file depends on the stl library. I chose to avoid inheritence with this small project as a challange and also to avoid any vtables. 

## how to use


## Deprecated branch
This used to be a school assignment where we were given a basic state machine that used inheritence and had to extend it's functionality. I chose to extend it by making it a hierarchical state machine. 

Whilst I was working with this code I realized it was really annoying and a lot of work to create and use new states. This is why I deprecated it and started working on a simple to use state machine.

## To-Do
- [x] make headeronly
- [x] add proper example(s)
- [ ] add how-to-use section
- [x] adjust cmakelist for including in other projects
- [ ] maybe put it in a namespace???
